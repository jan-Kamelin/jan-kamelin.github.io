      <h1>Conlangs</h1>
    </header>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I really enjoy learning about other peoples' conlangs and making my own. I speak Toki Pona and I have a basic understanding of Esperanto. This page will eventually have places to learn about different conlangs, including my own.</p>
    <p>This page is still under construction.</p>
    <p>Planned additions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Toki Pona version</li>
      <li>Different conlang portals</li>
      <li>History of conlangs</li>
      <li>Maybe more in the future</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please <a href="mailto:mi@jankamelin.xyz">email me</a> if you have any suggestions.</p>
